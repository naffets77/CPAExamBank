                Hey did you forget your password? 
                                    <br>
                <br>
                No problem, put in the email that you registered with and we'll send you an email with a 
                                    temporary password. 
                                    <br>
                <br>
                If that doesn't work, and you think you may have forgotten your email address or mistyped it, then please contact 
                                    us and we'll get in touch to figure out what happened.
