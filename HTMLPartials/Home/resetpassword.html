            Hey did you forget your password? 
                                <br>
            <br>
            No problem, put in the email that you registered with and we'll send you an email with a 
                                temporary password. 
                                <br>
            <br>
            If that doesn't work, and you think you may have forgotten your email address or mistyped it, then please contact 
                                us and we'll get in touch to figure out what happened. 
        </p>
